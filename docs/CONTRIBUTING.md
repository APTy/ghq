# Contributing

## Status

Currently, we only support developers contributing to the frontend (Next.js / React app).

It's difficult to share the backend due to SaaS credentials (Supabase and Clerk), and we haven't had time to build out the developer experience yet. If you're interested in helping with this, let us know!

## Developer setup

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GHQ_FRONTEND_ONLY=true

yarn
yarn run dev
yarn run dev:server # not yet available
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/local to start developing!

## Issue tracking

Please use GitHub issues to let us know what you're working on before submitting a pull request, thanks!
